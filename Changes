Revision history for Linux::Smaps::Tiny

    - Ever since 0.09 we haven't been using the XS version at all.

      The reason for this was that due to our intaction with
      Dist::Zilla we wouldn't define a $VERSION at BEGIN time, and
      would default to 0.01 as a placeholder, DynaLoader would
      silently fail to load it, and we'd always use the pure-perl
      version.

    - We now warn on compile-time if we can't load the XS version.

    - Document how to use the pure-perl version directly, and make it
      use the same API, for anyone who's interested in that, e.g. for
      testing.

    - Update the benchmark v.s. Linux::Smaps for its latest version &
      ours. We're proportionally faster now than when I initially
      released this.
